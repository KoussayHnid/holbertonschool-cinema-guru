This project is a great opportunity to dive deeper into React, building a practical pocket movie app. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to approach it:

*1.ProjectOvervie:
You'll be building a movie app that tracks favorite movies and manages a watch-later list using React.
You’ll utilize APIs to fetch movie data, manage state with hooks, and ensure smooth navigation using React Router.
*2.LearningObjectives
State and Props: 
Learn to handle React component states and props efficiently.
React Hooks: 
Master the use of hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) to manage component behavior.
API Integration: 
Use axios to fetch and post data to your backend.
Component Design: 
Create a well-organized UI by breaking the app into reusable components using JSX and CSS.
*3.Requirements
Functional Components Only:
 No class components.
ES6: 
Make use of modern JavaScript features like destructuring, arrow functions, and template literals.
Docker: 
You’ll be using Docker and docker-compose to manage the backend server.
Package Manager: 
Use yarn as your package manager instead of npm.
*4.ProjectSetup
Cloning and Running Backend: 
Follow the instructions to clone and run the backend using Docker, ensuring your server is accessible at http://localhost:8000/.
*5.ComponentBreakdown
General Components: Start by building reusable components like Input, SelectInput, Button, and SearchBar. These will be used across multiple sections of your app:

Input Component: Manage input fields with controlled states.
Button Component: Handle user interactions like form submissions.
SelectInput Component: Manage dropdowns for movie genres or categories.
Main App Setup:

In App.js, initialize state for user authentication and handle login/logout flows using useState and useEffect.
Depending on the user's authentication status (isLoggedIn), either render the Dashboard or the Authentication screen.
*6.Authentication
Components: Build Authentication, Login, and Register components:
Login/Registration: Handle the input for username and password and submit to the backend using axios.
State Management: Use useState to manage form fields and handle user input.
JWT Token: After a successful login/registration, store the JWT token in localStorage and update the authentication state.
*7.Dashboard
Header and Sidebar: Create a navigation structure using a Header component to display the user’s info and a SideBar component for navigation between Home, Favorites, and Watch Later.
Routing: Use react-router-dom to manage the app's routes and handle navigation between different pages like Home, Favorites, and Watch Later.
Activity Feed: Display a list of recent activities in the sidebar.
*8.MovieComponents
Tag Component: Use it to filter movies by genre, allowing users to refine their movie searches.
API Integration: Fetch movie data, genres, and user activities using axios from your backend API.
